# Office Building Automation with Object-Oriented Programming in C#
This project aims to explore object-oriented programming (OOP) principles within the C# programming language, by developing an automated system for an office building. The system will incorporate various modules such as security systems, temperature control, lighting systems, and elevator controls, using OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have a basic understanding of C# programming language, object-oriented programming principles, and software engineering concepts. You will also need to have a C# development environment set up on your computer.
Usage
Once the project is installed, you can run it in your development environment, and start exploring the various modules and functionalities of the system. You can also modify the code to add new features or make improvements to the existing ones.
